### **Running the program**
* `java -jar Assignment6.jar -file path-of-script-file`: The program opens the
  script file, executes it, and then shuts down when this is entered in the terminal.
* `java -jar Assignment6.jar -text`:  The program opens an interactive text mode, 
   allowing the user to type the script and execute it one line at a time when this is entered in 
   the terminal.
* `java -jar Assignment6.jar`: The program opens the GUI when this is entered in the terminal.

### **Loading an image**
This is the very first step that you must complete in order to do different commands on the
image. You must load the image in first. Essentially, loading an image is as simple as clicking 
on the load button. You may only load images in the 4 formats supported by the application which 
are ASCII .ppm, .jpg, .png, and .bmp.

## **Manipulations**

### **Saving an Image**
After you alter the image in whichever way you want, this is the last step you need to complete
in order to save the image to your device to appropriate present working directory. You can save 
the image in multiple different formats. The 4 formats supported by the application are ASCII .ppm,
.jpg, .png, and .bmp. Any image that you alter or just want to save can be done by clicking on the
save button with the appropriate image loaded into the GUI and the program will save exactly 
what you see in the image section.

<br>
Finally, if at any point in time you would like to quit the application, click the red x at the 
top of the GUI to close it.

### **Conditions**
Make sure that you adhere to the appropriate constraints when performing an image manipulation. 
In the case that you enter a negative number or try to perform a manipulation before loading an 
image, then it will cause an error message window to pop-up.
